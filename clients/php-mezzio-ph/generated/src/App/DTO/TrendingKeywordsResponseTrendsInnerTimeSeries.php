/**
 * A sequence of weekly observations of the relative search volume for this keyword over the past year.&lt;br /&gt; These values are normalized to a [0-100] range, and can be used to visualize the history of user interest in this keyword. By default, normalization is applied independently to the time series of each keyword, but the &#x60;normalize_against_group&#x60; query parameter can be used in cases where you wish to compare relative volume between keywords.&lt;br /&gt; **Note**: The date of each observation is in ISO-8601 format and represents the *end* of the week.  For example, a value of &#x60;2023-10-31&#x60; would include searches that happened between &#x60;2023-10-25&#x60; and &#x60;2023-10-31&#x60;.
