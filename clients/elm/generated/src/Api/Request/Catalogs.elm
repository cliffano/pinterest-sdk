This specific POST endpoint is designed to be idempotent. - By default, the \"operation user_account\" is the token user_account.  Optional: Business Access: Specify an <code>ad_account_id</code> (obtained via <a href='/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list'>List ad accounts</a>) to use the owner of that ad_account as the \"operation user_account\". In order to do this, the token user_account must have one of the following <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts\">Business Access</a> roles on the ad_account: Owner, Admin, Catalogs Manager.  <a href='/docs/shopping/catalog/'>Learn more</a>
